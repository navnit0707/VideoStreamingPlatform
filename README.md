# Flow of development of This course

    This project is bootstrapped starting from the scractch

    ## Create React App
    ## Tailwind Setup
       npm i tailwindcss
       npx tailwind init to create a tailwind config file
       setting path of the file where tailwind css will applies  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],

       setting tailwind directives to the main css file i.e
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;

## redux store to manage state

    redux toolkit setup:- npm i @reduxjs/tookit
    react-redux setup :- npm i react-redux

    setup of store
        1. create a store in utils folder  (store.js)
        2. create a slice to manage app data
        3. created  reducer and actions
        3. configure the store and slice .
        5. provide store to teh app by Provider store={store}


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
